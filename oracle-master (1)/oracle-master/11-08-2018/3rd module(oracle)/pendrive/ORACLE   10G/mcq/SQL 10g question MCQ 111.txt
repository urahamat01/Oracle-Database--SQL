You want to retrieve all employees, whether or not they have matching departments in 
the departments table. Which query would you use? 

A. SELECT last_name, department_name 
FROM employees , departments(+); 
B. SELECT last_name, department_name 
FROM employees JOIN departments (+); 
C. SELECT last_name, department_name 
FROM employees(+) e JOIN departments d 
ON (e.department_id = d.department_id); 
D. SELECT last_name, department_name 
FROM employees e 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN departments d ON (e.department_id = d.department_id); 
E. SELECT last_name, department_name 
FROM employees(+) , departments 
ON (e.department_id = d.department_id); 
F. SELECT last_name, department_name 
FROM employees e LEFT OUTER 
JOIN departments d ON (e.department_id = d.department_id); 
Answer: F 

Explanation: 
Answer F is correct. This query shows correct syntax to retrieve all employees, whether or not 
they have matching departments in the department table. Oracle9i extends its compliance with 
ANSI/ISO by supporting that standard’s requirements for outer join syntax and semantics. 

Incorrect Answers 
A: 
This query uses “+” to create outer join as it was in Oracle8i, but it requires also usage of 
WHERE clause in SELECT statement. 
B: 
The JOIN clause cannot be used with in conjunction with “+”: syntax is incorrect. 
C: 
The JOIN clause cannot be used with in conjunction with “+”: syntax is incorrect. 
D: 
This statement requires LEFT OUTER JOIN, not RIGHT OUTER JOIN. 
E: 
This query uses incorrect syntax with “+” and ON to create outer join. 

QUESTION NO: 2 
Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table: 

EMPLOYEE_ID NUMBER Primary Key 
FIRST_NAME VARCHAR2(25) 
LAST_NAME VARCHAR2(25) 

Which three statements inserts a row into the table? (Choose three) 

A. INSERT INTO employees 
VALUES ( NULL, ‘John’,‘Smith’); 
B. INSERT INTO employees( first_name, last_name) 
VALUES(‘John’,‘Smith’); 
C. INSERT INTO employees 
VALUES (‘1000’,‘John’,NULL); 
D. INSERT INTO employees(first_name,last_name, employee_id) 
VALUES ( 1000, ‘John’,‘Smith’); 
E. 
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id) 
VALUES (1000); 
F. 
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name) 
VALUES ( 1000, ‘John’,‘’); 
Answer: C, E, F 

Explanation: 
Since EMPLOYEE_ID column is used as primary key, it cannot be NULL, so only INSERT 
statements in C, E and F are correct. You can insert the row with NULL LAST_NAME as in 
answer C, or only the row with EMPLOYEE_ID as in answer E, or the row with empty 
LAST_NAME column. 
Incorrect Answers 
A: 
This answer is incorrect because a primary key cannot be NULL. 
B: 
INSERT statement does not contain primary key value at all, so this answer needs to be 
eliminated as correct one. 
D: 
This statement shows incorrect order of columns of row which needs to be inserted into 
the table.

on to others. 
Incorrect Answers 
A: 
This statement would be correct if it included WITH GRANT OPTION clause to allow 
this role to pass those privileges on to others. 
B: 
This statement uses incorrect clause TO ROLE. 
C: 
There is no option with name MODIFY in the GRANT command. 
E: 
This statement uses incorrect clause TO ROLE. 
F: 
There is no option with name MODIFY in the GRANT command. And this statement also

Explanation: 
These answers show correct syntax, because they use ANY and ALL keywords for convert multi-row output of sub-query to one-row result. 

Incorrect Answers 
A: 
This SELECT statement is incorrect because of multi-row return of sub-query: it will 
return minimal salary for EACH department. 
B: 
This SELECT statement is incorrect because of multi-row return of sub-query: it will 
return average salary for EACH department. 
F: 
This SELECT statement is incorrect because GROUP BY clause cannot contain functions, 
like AVG(), MIN(), MAX() and so on.

Which two statements about views are true? (Choose two.) 


A. A view can be created as read only. 
B. A view can be created as a join on two or more tables. 
C. A view cannot have an ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement. 
D. A view cannot be created with a GROUP BY clause in the SELECT statement. 
E. A view must have aliases defined for the column names in the SELECT statement. 
Answer: A, B 
Explanation: 

A view can be created as read only object. However, it is possible to change data in the 
underlying table(s) with some restrictions.A view also can be created as a join on two or more 
tables. This type of view is called complex view. Complex views provide complicated data 
models where many base tables are drawn together into one virtual table. 

Incorrect Answers 

C: 
Query operations containing ORDER BY clause are also permitted, so long as the 
ORDER BY clause appearsoutside the parentheses. The following is an example of what I 
mean: CREATE VIEW my_view AS (SELECT*FROM emp) ORDER BYempno. 
D: 
A view can be created with a GROUP BY clause in the SELECT statement. 
E: 
It is not required to have aliases defined for the column names in the SELECT statement.

E. SELECT dept_id, job_cat, MAX(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY dept_id, job_cat, salary; 
Answer: B 

Explanation: 
This answer provides correct syntax and semantics to show the maximum salary paid in each 
job category of each department. 
Incorrect Answers 
A: 
This query will not return any row because condition SALARY > MAX(SALARY) is 
FALSE. 
C: 
This query will return error because you cannot show maximum salary with DEPT_ID 
and JOB_CAT without grouping by these columns. 
D: 
The GROUP BY clause is missing JOB_ID column. 
E: 
You don’t need to group results of query by SALARY in the GROUP BY column.

QUESTION NO: 8 
Management has asked you to calculate the value 12*salary* commission_pct for all the 
employees in the EMP table. The EMP table contains these columns: 

LAST NAME VARCNAR2(35) NOT NULL 
SALARY NUMBER(9,2) NOT NULL 
COMMISION_PCT NUMBER(4,2) 

Which statement ensures that a value is displayed in the calculated columns for all 
employees? 

A. SELECT last_name, 12*salary* commission_pct FROM emp; 
B. SELECT last_name, 12*salary* (commission_pct,0) FROM emp; 
C. SELECT last_name, 12*salary*(nvl(commission_pct,0)) FROM emp; 
D. SELECT last_name, 12*salary*(decode(commission_pct,0))FROM emp; 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

This SELECT statement provides correct usage of NVL function to calculate columns for all 
employees. Oracle give you possibility to substitute a value in place of NULL. The basic 
syntax for NVL() is NVL(column_name, value_if_null). Notice that the column specified in 
NVL() contains an actual value. That value is what Oracle returns; when the column is NULL, 
the special string is returned. The value specified to be returned if the column value is NULL 
must be the same datatype as the column specified. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
This SELECT statement will return NULL value for rows with NULL 
COMMISION_PCT column. 
B: 
It is incorrect syntax in this query: NVL function needs to be used for correct result. 
D: 
The DECODE function is used as substitution of IF-THEN-ELSE PL/SQL construction in 
SQL queries. The SELECT statement provides incorrect syntax of it cannot have only two 
parameters.

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
This SELECT statement will return NULL value for rows with NULL 
COMMISION_PCT column. 
B: 
There is no IFNULL() function in Oracle. 
C: 
The NVL2() function requires 3 parameters, not 2. Function NVL2(expr1, expr2, expr3) 
returns expr2 if expr1 is not NULL. If expr1 is NULL, it returns expr3.

Evaluate the set of SQL statements: 

CREATE TABLE dept 
(deptno NUMBER(2), 
dname VARCNAR2(14), 
loc VARCNAR2(13)); 
ROLLBACK; 
DESCRIBE DEPT 

What is true about the set? 

A. The DESCRIBE DEPT statement displays the structure of the DEPT table. 
B. The ROLLBACK statement frees the storage space occupies by the DEPT table. 
C. The DESCRIBE DEPT statement returns an error ORA-04043: object DEPT does not exist. 
D. The DESCRIBE DEPT statement displays the structure of the DEPT table only if there is a COMMIT statement introduced before the ROLLBACK statement. 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 

The structure of the DEPT table will be displayed because the CREATE TABLE statement is 
DDL operation and it cannot be rolled back because implicit commit occurs on the database 
when a user exits SQL*Plus or issues a data-definition language (DDL) command such as a 
create table statement, user to create a database object, or an alter table statement, used to 
alter a database object. 

Incorrect Answers 

B: 
The ROLLBACK statement has nothing to do with the storage space of the DEPT table. 
C: 
The DESCRIBE DEPT statement does not produce the error. It displays the structure of 
the DEPT table. 
D: 
The COMMIT statement does not need to be introduced because implicit commit occurs 
on the database after creation of the table.

Evaluate this SQL statement: 

SELECT employee_id, e.department_id, department_name, salary FROM employees e, departments d 
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id; 

Which SQL statement is equivalent to the above SQL statement? 

A. SELECT employee_id, department_id, department_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id  FROM departments); 
B. SELECT employee_id, department_id, department_name, salary FROM employees NATURAL JOIN departments; 
C. SELECT employee_id, d.department_id, department_name, salary FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id; 
D. SELECT employee_id, department_id, department_name, Salary FROM employees JOIN departments USING (e.department_id, d.department_id); 

Answer: C 
Explanation: 

This query shows correct JOIN ON clause syntax and provides equivalent to the above SQL 
statement. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
This statement will show data only for the EMPLOYEES table with records that have 
department ID from DEPARTMENTS table, not join result of two tables. 
B: NATURAL join selects rows from the tables that have equal values in all matched 
columns (same column names). If the columns having the same names have different 
datatypes, an error is returned. 
D: 
There is incorrect usage of JOIN clause with USING keyword.

QUESTION NO: 21 
The EMP table contains these columns: 


LAST NAME VARCHAR2(25) 
SALARY NUMBER(6,2) 
DEPARTMENT_ID NUMBER(6) 

You need to display the employees who have not been assigned to any department. 
You write the SELECT statement: 

SELECT LAST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID 
FROM EMP 
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = NULL; 

What is true about this SQL statement? 

A. The SQL statement displays the desired results. 
B. The column in the WHERE clause should be changed to display the desired results. 
C. The operator in the WHERE clause should be changed to display the desired results. 
D. The WHERE clause should be changed to use an outer join to display the desired 
results. 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

The operator in the WHERE clause should be changed to display the desired results. There are 
times when you want to substitute a value in place of NULL. Oracle provides this 

functionality with a special function, called NVL(). You cannot use operation equal with 
NULL, but you can achieve desired results using NVL() function after the WHERE clause. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
The SQL statement will generate an error because you cannot use operation equal with 
NULL. 
B: 
The column in the WHERE clause should not be changed to display the desired results. 
D: 
Since there is only one table used in this query you don’t need to use outer join to display 
the desired results.

QUESTION NO: 22 
Evaluate the SQL statement: 

SELECT ROUND(TRUNC(MOD(1600,10),-1),2) 
FROM dual; 

What will be displayed? 

A. 0 
B. 1 
C. 0.00 
D. An error statement 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 

Result will be 0. MOD(x,y) function calculates the modulus of x, defined in long division as 
the integer remainder when x is divided by y until no further whole number can be produced. 
TRUNC() function truncates x to the decimal precision of y. ROUND(x,y) rounds x to the 
decimal precision of y. 

Incorrect Answers 

B: 
Result will be 0, not 1. 
C: 
Result will be 0, not 0.00 because MOD(1600,10) return 0 and all other functions 
(TRUNC and ROUND) return 0 also. 
D: 
There is no error in this statement.

Examine the description of the MARKS table: 

STD_ID NUMBER(4) 
STUDENT_NAME VARCHAR2(30) 
SUBJ1 NUMBER(3) 
SUBJ2 NUMBER(3) 

SUBJ1 and SUBJ2 indicate the marks obtained by a student in two subjects. 
Examine this SELECT statement based on the MARKS table: 

SELECT subj1+subj2 total_marks, std_id 
FROM marks 
WHERE subj1 > AVG(subj1) AND subj2 > AVG(subj2) 
ORDER BY total_marks; 


What is the result of the SELECT statement? 

A. The statement executes successfully and returns the student ID and sum of all marks 
for each student who obtained more than the average mark in each subject. 
B. The statement returns an error at the SELECT clause. 
C. The statement returns an error at the WHERE clause. 
D. The statement returns an error at the ORDER BY clause. 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

The statement returns an error at the WHERE clause because group function AVG() cannot be 
used in the WHERE clause. Group functions can be used in SELECT clause and GROUP BY 
clause. They allow you to perform data operations on several values in a column of data as 
though the column were one collective group of data. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: The statement does not execute successfully because an error will be generated. 
B: The statement returns an error at the WHERE, not at the SELECT clause. 
D: The statement returns an error at the WHERE, not at the ORDER BY clause.

ORDER_ID NUMBER, 
ORDER_DATE DATE NOT NULL 
STATUS VARCHARD2(10) 
CHECK (status IN (‘CREDIT’,’CASH’)), 
PROD_ID_NUMBER 
REFERENCES PRODUCTS(PRODUCT_ID),

For which columns would an index be automatically created when you execute the above 
SQL statement? (Choose two) 

A. SER_NO 
B. ORDER_ID 
C. STATUS 
D. PROD_ID 
E. ORD_TOTAL 
F. 
Composite index on ORDER_ID and ORDER_DATE 
Answer: A, F 
Explanation: 

Indexes are created automatically by Oracle to support integrity constraints that enforce 
uniqueness. The two types of integrity constraints that enforce uniqueness are PRIMARY 
KEY and UNIQUE constraints. When the primary key or UNIQUE constraint is declared, a 
unique index to support the column’s uniqueness is also created, and all values in all columns 
that were defined as part of the primary key or UNIQUE constraint are placed into the index. 

Incorrect Answers 

B: 
There will not be index for ORDER_ID column. 
C: 
There will not be index for STATUS column. 
D: 
There will not be index for PROD_ID column. 
E: 
There will not be index for ORD_TOTAL column. 

QUESTION NO: 28 
You created a view called EMP_DEPT_VU that contains three columns from the EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS tables: 
EMPLOYEE_ID, EMPLOYEE_NAME AND DEPARTMENT_NAME. The DEPARTMENT_ID column of the EMPLOYEES table is the foreign key to the 
primary key DEPARTMENT_ID column of the DEPARTMENTS table. You want to modify the view by adding a fourth column, MANAGER_ID of NUMBER 
data type from the EMPLOYEES tables. 
How can you accomplish this task? 


A. ALTER VIEW emp_dept_vu (ADD manager_id NUMBER); 
B. MODIFY VIEW emp_dept_vu (ADD manager_id NUMBER); 
C. ALTER VIEW emp_dept_vu AS SELECT employee_id, employee_name, department_name, manager_id FROM employee e, departments d WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id; 
D. MODIFY VIEW emp_dept_vu AS SELECT employee_id, employee_name, department_name, manager_id FROM employees e, departments d WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id; 
E. CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emp_dept_vu AS SELECT employee_id, employee_name, department_name, manager_id FROM employees e, departments d WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id; 
F. You must remove the existing view first, and then run the CREATE VIEW command with a new column list to modify a view. 
Answer: E 
Explanation: 

When we want to alter the underlying data used in the definition of a view, we use the 
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement. When a CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW 
statement is issued, Oracle will disregard the error that arises when it encounters the view that 
already exists with that name, and it will overwrite the definition for the old view with the 
definition for the new one. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
There is no ALTER VIEW command in Oracle. 
B: 
There is no MODIFY VIEW command in Oracle. 
C: 
There is no ALTER VIEW command in Oracle. 
D: 
There is no MODIFY VIEW command in Oracle. 
F: 
You don’t need to remove the existing view to create modified view. You are able to do 
that with CREATE OR REPLACE command.

Oracle will not implicitly create an unique index for the NOT NULL constraint. 
C: 
Oracle will not implicitly create an unique index for the FOREIGN KEY constraint. 
D: 
Oracle will not implicitly create an unique index for the FOREIGN KEY constraint.

EMPLOYEES 
EMPLOYEE_ID NUMBER Primary Key 
FIRST_NAME VARCHARD2(25) 
LAST_NAME VARCHARD2(25) 
HIRE_DATE DATE 
NEW EMPLOYEES 
EMPLOYEE_ID NUMBER Primary Key

Which UPDATE statement is valid? 

A. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (Select last_name|| first_name FROM employees Where employee_id =180) WHERE employee_id =180; 
B. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (SELECT last_name||first_name FROM employees) WHERE employee_id =180; 
C. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (SELECT last_name|| first_name FROM employees WHERE employee_id =180) WHERE employee_id =(SELECT employee_id FROM new employees); 
D. UPDATE new_employees SET name = (SELECT last name|| first_name FROM employees WHERE employee_id= (SELECT employee_id FROM new_employees)) WHERE employee_id =180; 

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Sub-query in this answer will return one row value, concatenated first and last name for the 
employee with ID 180, so update will be successful. When sub-queries are linked to the parent by equality comparisons, 
the parent query expects only one row of data from the sub-query. 

Incorrect Answers 

B: 
Sub-query will return concatenated first and last name for ALL records from the table 
EMPLOYEES. It will cause an error for the parent query, because it expects one only one 
row. 
C: 
Last WHERE statement in this query will generate error because sub-query returns multi-
row result. 
D: 
SELECT statement for the NEW_EMPLOYEES table in this query will generate error 
because sub-query returns multi-row result.

D. CREATE VIEW emp_Vu AS SELECT employee_id, emp_name, job_id, DISTINCT department_id FROM employees; 

Answer: B 

Explanation: 

This statement will create view that can be used to change tables in underlying table through 
simple views. It includes primary key, NOT NULL column and foreign key to avoid 
constraint restrictions. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
This statement does not include JOB_ID column that cannot be NULL. In general, all 
constraint restrictions defined on the underlying table also apply to modifying data via the 
view. For example, you can’t add data to an underlying table via a view that violates the 
table’s primary key constraint. 
C: 
You cannot update a column of an underlying table if the simple view use a single-row 
function to define the column. 
D: 
You may not insert, update, or delete records data on the table underlying the simple view 
if the SELECT statement creating the view contains a GROUP BY clause, GROUP 
function, or DISTINCT clause.

QUESTION NO: 37 
Which two are true about aggregate functions? (Choose two.) 

A. You can use aggregate functions in any clause of a SELECT statement. 
B. You can use aggregate functions only in the column list of the SELECT clause and in the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement. 
C. You can mix single row columns with aggregate functions in the column list of a SELECT statement by grouping on the single row columns. 
D. You can pass column names, expressions, constants, or functions as parameters to an aggregate function. 
E. You can use aggregate functions on a table, only by grouping the whole table as one single group. 
F. You cannot group the rows of a table by more than one column while using aggregate functions. 
Answer: C, D 
Explanation: 

It is possible to mix single row columns with aggregate functions in the column list of a 
SELECT statement by grouping on the single row columns. Also it is acceptable to pass 
column names, expressions, constraints, or other functions as parameters to an aggregate 
function. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
You cannot use aggregate functions in any clause of a SELECT statement. For example, 
they cannot be used with a WHEN statement. 
B: 
It is not possible to use aggregate functions in the WHERE clause of a SELECT 
statement. But they can be used with a HAVING clause used after the GROUP BY clause, 
for example. 
E:

QUESTION NO: 40 
The STUDENT_GRADES table has these columns: 

STUDENT_ID NUMBER(12) 
SEMESTER_END DATE 
GPA NUMBER(4,3) 

The register has requested a report listing the students' grade point averages (GPA), 
sorted from highest grade point average to lowest within each semester, starting from 
the earliest date. Which statement accomplishes this? 

A. SELECT student_id, semester_end, gpa FROM student_grades ORDER BY semester_end DESC, gpa DESC; 
B. SELECT student_id, semester_end, gpa FROM student_grades ORDER BY semester_end ASC, gpa ASC; 
C. SELECT student_id, semester_end, gpa FROM student_grades ORDER BY semester_end, gpa DESC; 
D. SELECT student_id, semester_end, gpa FROM student_grades ORDER BY gpa DESC, semester_end DESC; 
E. SELECT student_id, semester_end, gpa FROM student_grades ORDER BY gpa DESC, semester_end ASC; 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

This answer shows correct syntax and semantics to receive desired result. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
Semesters will be sorted started from the oldest date, not the earliest. 
B: 
GPA data will be sorted in ascending order, what is opposite to our task. 
D: 
Semesters will be sorted started from the oldest date, not the earliest. Only difference with 
answer A is order of columns in the ORDER BY clause. 
E: 
This query has wrong order of columns to sort: results need to be sorted first by semester, 
than by grade point average. 

QUESTION NO: 41 
The ORDERS table has these columns: 

ORDER_ID NUMBER(4) NOT NULL 
CUSTOMER_ID NUMBER(12) NOT NULL 
ORDER_TOTAL NUMBER(10,2) 

The ORDERS table tracks the Order number, the order total, and the customer to 
whom the Order belongs. Which two statements retrieve orders with an inclusive total 
that ranges between 100.00 and 2000.00 dollars? (Choose two.) 

A. SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_total FROM orders RANGE ON order_total (100 AND 2000) INCLUSIVE; 
B. SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_total FROM orders HAVING order_total BETWEEN 100 and 2000; 
C. SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_total FROM orders WHERE order_total BETWEEN 100 and 2000; 
D. SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_total FROM orders WHERE order_total >= 100 and <= 2000; 
E. SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_total FROM orders WHERE order_total >= 100 and order_total <= 2000; 
Answer: C, E 
Explanation: 

Answers C and E provide correct results to show. You can use BETWEEN or comparison 
operations to retrieve data. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: There is no RANGE ON or INCLUSIVE keyword in Oracle. 
B: HAVING clause can be use only in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause. 
D: Syntax “order_total >= 100 and <= 2000” is incorrect.

108 Jennifer HR_MGR 4500 

The EMP_HIST table is updated at the end of every year. The employee ID, name, job 
ID, and salary of each existing employee are modified with the latest data. New employee 
details are added to the table. 
Which statement accomplishes this task? 


A. UPDATE emp_hist SET employee_id, name, job_id, salary = (SELECT employee_id, name, job_id, salary FROM employees) WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employees); 
B. MERGE INTO emp_hist eh USING employees e ON (eh.employee_id = e.employee_id) WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET eh.name = e.name, eh.job_id = e.job_id, eh.salary = e.salary WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (e.employee id, e.name, e.job id, e.salary); 
C. MERGE INTO emp_hist eh USING employees e ON (eh.employee_id = e.employee_id) WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE emp hist SET eh.name = e.name, eh.job_id = e.job_id, eh.salary = e.salary WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT INTO emp_hist VALUES (e.employee_id, e.name, e.job_id, e.salary); 
D. MERGE INTO emp_hist eh USING employees e WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE emp_hist SET eh.name = e.name, eh.job_id = e.job_id, eh.salary = e.salary WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT INTO emp_hist VALUES (e.employee_id, e.name, e.job_id, e.salary); 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 

This task can be done using the MERGE command. Correct syntax for the MERGE command is MERGE INTO table1 USING table2 on (join_condition) WHEN MATCHED UPDATE 
SET col1 = value WHEN NOT MATCHED INSERT (column_list) values (column_values). 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
MERGE command can handle this task, not UPDATE: new employee details will not be 
added to the table 
C: 
This statement would by correct if UPDATE SET is syntax used, not UPDATE 
table_name SET syntax as in usual UPDATE command. 
D: 
“ON condition” clause of the MERGE command is absent.

In which case would you use a FULL OUTER JOIN? 

A. Both tables have NULL values. 
B. You want all unmatched data from one table. 
C. You want all matched data from both tables. 
D. You want all unmatched data from both tables. 
E. One of the tables has more data than the other. 
F. You want all matched and unmatched data from only one table. 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 

Oracle9i also makes it possible for you to easily execute a full outer join, including all records 
from the tables that would have been displayed if you had used both LEFT OUTER JOIN or 
RIGTH OUTER JOIN clauses. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
You will not use a FULL OUTER JOIN if both tables have NULL values. 
B: 
You will not use a FULL OUTER JOIN if you want all unmatched data from one table. 
Only LEFT OUTER JOIN or RIGTH OUTER JOIN needs to be used. 
C: 
You want all unmatched, not matched, data from both tables. 
E: 
It is not a criterion to use a FULL OUTER JOIN if one of the tables has more data than 
the other. 
F: 
You want all unmatched, not matched data or a combination of matched and unmatched 
data, from both tables, not one table.

The EMP table has these columns: 

ENAME VARCHAR2(35) 
SALARY NUMBER(8,2) 
HIRE_DATE DATE 

Management wants a list of names of employees who have been with the company for 
more than five years. Which SQL statement displays the required results? 

A. SELECT ENAME FROM EMP WHERE SYSDATE-HIRE_DATE > 5; 
B. SELECT ENAME FROM EMP WHERE HIRE_DATE-SYSDATE > 5; 
C. SELECT ENAME FROM EMP WHERE (SYSDATE-HIRE_DATE)/365 > 5; 
D. SELECT ENAME FROM EMP WHERE (SYSDATE-HIRE_DATE)* 365 > 5; 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

Expression SYSDATE-HIRE_DATE will show number of days after date of hiring employee, 
so you need to divide result of expression on 365 and this compare result with 5. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
This query returns all employees who were hired more than 5 days ago. 
B: 
This query will not return any record because result of HIRE_DATE-SYSDATE 
expression will be negative number. 
D: 
You need to divide, not to multiply, SYSDATE-HIRE_DATE on the number of days in 1 
year.

On the EMPLOYEES table, EMPLOYEE_ID is the primary key. MGR_ID is the ID of 
managers and refers to the EMPLOYEE_ID. The JOB_ID column is a NOT NULL 
column. 
Evaluate this DELETE statement: 


DELETE employee_id, salary, job_id 
FROM employees 
WHERE dept_id = 90; 

Why does the DELETE statement fail when you execute it? 

A. There is no row with dept_id 90 in the EMPLOYEES table. 
B. You cannot delete the JOB_ID column because it is a NOT NULL column. 
C. You cannot specify column names in the DELETE clause of the DELETE statement. 
D. You cannot delete the EMPLOYEE_ID column because it is the primary key of the table. 
Answer: C 

Explanation: 

You cannot specify column names in the DELETE clause of the DELETE statement. Syntax 
of this command is: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
Error in this statement is related with list of columns in the DELETE statement, not with 
absence of row with DEPT_ID = 90 in the EMPLOYEES table. 
B: 
Error in this statement is related with list of columns in the DELETE statement, not with 
NOT NULL constraint on the JOB_ID column. 
D: 
Error in this statement is related with list of columns in the DELETE statement, not with 
the primary key constraint on the EMPLOYEE_ID column.

Evaluate these two SQL statements: 


SELECT last_name, salary , hire_date 
FROM EMPLOYEES 
ORDER BY salary DESC; 
SELECT last_name, salary, hire_date 
FROM EMPLOYEES 
ORDER BY 2 DESC; 

What is true about them? 

A. The two statements produce identical results. 
B. The second statement returns a syntax error. 
C. There is no need to specify DESC because the results are sorted in descending order by default. 
D. The two statements can be made to produce identical results by adding a column alias 
for the salary column in the second SQL statement. 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 

These two statements produce identical results, because it is possible even to use numbers to 
indicate the column position where Oracle should order the output from a statement. 

Incorrect Answers 

B: 
Second statement is correct and it will not return a syntax error. 
C: 
The results are sorted in ascending order by default. 
D: 
There is no corrections need to be made for the statements. They will return identical 
results.

You would like to display the system date in the format "Monday, 01 June, 2001". 
Which SELECT statement should you use? 

A. SELECT TO_DATE(SYSDATE, 'FMDAY, DD Month, YYYY') FROM dual; 
B. SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'FMDD, DY Month, 'YYY')  FROM dual; 
C. SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'FMDay, DD Month, YYYY') FROM dual; 
D. SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'FMDY, DDD Month, YYYY') FROM dual; 
E. SELECT TO_DATE(SYSDATE, 'FMDY, DDD Month, YYYY') FROM dual; 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

This answer is correct: “Day” shows the day spelled out, “DD” shows the two-digit date, 
“Month” provides the month spelled out, “YYYY” shows the four-digit year. “FMDay” is 
special format mask to suppresses the extra spaces between the name of the day and the 
number of the date. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
This statement will return an error because of inappropriate usage of the TO_DATE() 
function. 
B: 
Incorrect format mask “DY” is used to show the number of the day. 
D: 
Incorrect format mask “DY” is used to show the name of the day and format mask “DDD” 
is used to show the number of the day. 
E: 
Incorrect format mask “DY” is used to show the name of the day and format mask “DDD” 
is used to show the number of the day. Also this statement will return an error because of 
inappropriate usage of the TO_DATE() function.

Which statement finds the rows in the CUSTOMERS table that do not have a postal 
code? 

A. SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers WHERE postal_code CONTAINS NULL; 
B. SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers WHERE postal_code = '________'; 
C. SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers WHERE postal_code IS NULL; 
D. SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers WHERE postal code IS NVL; 
E. SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers WHERE postal_code = NULL; 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

This statement returns the rows in the CUSTOMERS table that do not have a postal code. The 
correct syntax to check NULL values is usage of “IS NULL” clause. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
“CONTAINS NULL” is incorrect clause in Oracle. 
B: 
This statement will just check if postal code equals to string ‘________'; 
D: 
Usage of “IS NVL” is incorrect in Oracle. But there is a function NVL() you can use to 
process NULL values. 
E: 
You can not use equal comparison to check whether value is NULL or not. Use 
construction “IS NULL” or “IS NOT NULL” to do that.

QUESTION NO: 57 
You need to create a view EMP_VU. The view should allow the users to manipulate the 
records of only the employees that are working for departments 10 or 20. 
Which SQL statement would you use to create the view EMP_VU? 


A. CREATE VIEW emp_vu AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (10,20); 
B. CREATE VIEW emp_vu AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (10,20) WITH READ ONLY; 
C. CREATE VIEW emp_vu AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (10,20) WITH CHECK OPTION; 
D. CREATE FORCE VIEW emp_vu AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (10,20); 
E. CREATE FORCE VIEW emp_vu AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (10,20) NO UPDATE; 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

Tables that underlie views often have constraints that limit the data that can be added to those 
tables. Views cannot add data to the underlying table that would violate the table’s 
constraints. However, you can also define a view to restrict the user’s ability to change 
underlying table data even further, effectively placing a special constraint for data 
manipulation through the view. This additional constraint says that INSERT or UPDATE 
statements issued against the view are cannot create rows that the view cannot subsequently 
select. This constraint is configured when the view is defined by adding the WITH CHECK 
OPTION to the CREATE VIEW statement. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: This view does not provide correct semantic of question task. 
B: WITH READ ONLY clause is incorrect syntax in the CREATE VIEW command. 
D: This view does not provide correct semantic of question task. 
E: NO UPDATE clause is incorrect syntax in the CREATE VIEW command.

C. SELECT student_id, marks, ROWNUM "Rank" FROM (SELECT student_id, marks FROM students WHERE ROWNUM <= 10 AND finish_date BETWEEN '01-JAN-99' AND '31-DEC-99' AND course_id = 'INT_SQL' ORDER BY marks DESC); 
D. SELECT student_id, marks, ROWNUM "Rank” FROM (SELECT student_id, marks FROM students ORDER BY marks DESC) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10 AND finish_date BETWEEN '01-JAN-99' AND '31-DEC-99' AND course_id = 'INT_SQL'; 


Answer: D 
Explanation: 

This statement using inline sub-query will provide correct results to show 10 students who 
achieved the highest ranking in the course INT SQL and who completed the course in the year 
1999.

Which four statements correctly describe functions that are available in SQL? (Choose four) 

A. INSTR returns the numeric position of a named character. 
B. NVL2 returns the first non-null expression in the expression list. 
C. TRUNCATE rounds the column, expression, or value to n decimal places. 
D. DECODE translates an expression after comparing it to each search value. 
E. TRIM trims the heading of trailing characters (or both) from a character string. 
F. NVL compares two expressions and returns null if they are equal, or the first expression of they are not equal. 
G. NULLIF compares twp expressions and returns null if they are equal, or the first expression if they are not equal. 
Answer: A, D, E, G 
Explanation: 

INSTR returns the numeric position of a named character. DECODE translates an expression 
after comparing it to each search value. TRIM trims the heading of trailing characters (or 
both) from a character string. NULLIF compares twp expressions and returns null if they are 
equal, or the first expression if they are not equal. 

Incorrect Answers 

B: 
This statement is not correct. The following is the Syntax for NVL2 function: 
NVL2(expr1, expr2, expr3). If expr1 is not null, NVL2 returns expr2. If expr1 is null, 
NVL2 returns expr3. 
C: 
Command TRUNCATE is used to remove all row data from the table, while leaving the 
definition of the table intact, including the definition of constraints and any associated 
database objects as indexes, constraints, and triggers on the table. 
F: 
NVL returns second parameter value if first one is NULL.

QUESTION NO: 60 
Examine the data from the EMP table: 


EMP_ID DEPT_ID COMMISSION 
1 10 500 
2 20 1000 
3 10 
4 10 600 
5 30 800 
6 30 200 
7 10 300 


The COMMISSION column shows the monthly commission earned by the employee. 
Which three tasks would require subqueries or joins in order to perform in a single 
step? (Choose three) 

A. Deleting the records of employees who do not earn commission. 
B. Increasing the commission of employee 3 by the average commission earned in department 20. 
C. Finding the number of employees who do NOT earn commission and are working for department 20. 
D. Inserting into the table a new employee 10 who works for department 20 and earns a commission that is equal to the commission earned by employee 3. 
E. Creating a table called COMMISSION that has the same structure and data as the columns EMP_ID and COMMISSIONS of the EMP table. 
F. Decreasing the commission by 150 for the employees who are working in department 30 and earning a commission of more then 800. 
Answer: B, D, E 
Explanation: 

Increasing the commission of employee 3 by the average commission earned in department 20 
will require sub-queries or joins in order to perform in a single step. Inserting into the table a 
new employee 10 who works for department 20 and earns a commission that is equal to the 
commission earned by employee 3 is correct answer also. To create a table that has the same 
structure as subset of columns from another table it’s required to use a subquery in order to 
perform in a single step. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
This query can be done without using sub-queries or joins in order to perform in a single 
step. 
C: 
It is not required to use sub-queries or joins to create SQL statement for that query. 
F: 
This query can be done without using sub-queries or joins in order to perform in a single 
step: only two conditions in the WHERE clause should be specified.

QUESTION NO: 66 
Mary has a view called EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU that was created based on the 
EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, and LOCATIONS tables. She granted SELECT 
privilege to Scott on this view. 
Which option enables Scott to eliminate the need to qualify the view with the name 
MARY .EMP_DEP_LOC_VU each time the view is referenced? 

A. Scott can create a synonym for the EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU bus using the command: CREATE PRIVATE SYNONYM EDL_VU FOR mary.EMP DEPT_LOC_VU; then he can prefix the columns with this synonymn. 
B. Scott can create a synonym for the EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU by using the command: CREATE SYNONYM EDL_VU FOR mary.EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU; then he can prefix the columns with this synonym. 
C. Scott can create a synonym for the EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU by using the command: CREATE LOCAL SYNONYM EDL_VU FOR mary.EMP DEPT_LOC_VU; then he can prefix the columns with this synonym. 
D. Scott can create a synonym for the EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU by using the command: CREATE SYNONYM EDL_VU ON mary(EMP_DEPT_LOC_VU); then he can prefix the columns with this synonym. 
E. Scott cannot create a synonym because synonyms can be created only for tables. 
F. Scott cannot create any synonym for Mary’s view. Mary should create a private synonym for the view and grant SELECT privilege on that synonym to Scott. 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 

Correct syntax to create a local synonym is CREATE SYNONYM synonym_name. With 
PUBLIC keyword you can create public synonym. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
There is no PRIVATE keyword for the CREATE SYNONYM command. 
C: 
There is no LOCAL keyword for the CREATE SYNONYM command. 
D: 
This SQL statement shows incorrect syntax to create a synonym. 
E: 
Synonyms can be created not only for tables but for other objects also.

In which scenario would index be most useful? 

A. The indexed column is declared as NOT NULL. 
B. The indexed columns are used in the FROM clause. 
C. The indexed columns are part of an expression. 
D. The indexed column contains a wide range of values. 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 

Index will be useful if the indexed column contains a wide range of values. Especially B-tree 
indexes will work better for tables with a wide range of values. But for tables just with some 
distinct values bitmap indexes will be more helpful. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
Oracle automatically creates index for NOT NULL columns, so you don’t need create an 
index yourself. 
B: 
There are only table names in the FROM clause, not columns. 
C: 
Index may be will not work if the indexed columns are part of an expression. You need to 
avoid expressions if you want to use index.

Which SQL statement generates the alias Annual Salary for the calculated column 
SALARY*12? 

A. SELECT ename, salary*12 ‘Annual Salary’ FROM employees; 
B. SELECT ename, salary*12 “Annual Salary” FROM employees; 
C. SELECT ename, salary*12 AS Annual Salary FROM employees; 
D. SELECT ename, salary*12 AS INITCAP(“ANNUAL SALARY”) FROM employees 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 

This SQL statement provides correct syntax to generate the alias Annual Salary for the 
calculated column SALARY*12. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
Alias can be surrounded with double quotation marks, not with single. Oracle error will be 
generated in this case.

B: 
This SQL statement will fail because it is not correct syntax for inline views. There is no a 
label for this inline view also. 
C: 
This SQL statement will fail because it is not correct syntax for inline views. There is no a 
label for this inline view also. 
D: 
This SQL statement will fail because it is not correct syntax for inline views. There is no a 
label for this inline view also.

privileges to the role and after that grant this role to specific users. By granting to or revoking 
privileges from the role you can simplify procedure of users privileges maintainance: you 
don’t need to grant/revoke privileges to/from each user. It’s especially very helpful when you 
are experiencing a high number of people using the database. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: Roles have nothing to do with simplifying the process of creating new users. 
B: You can use roles to grant a group of privileges to a user, but they can be not related at all. 
E: Roles have nothing to do with user who is constantly traveling.

Examine the structure of the EMPLOYEES table: 

EMPLOYEE_ID NUMBER NOT NULL 
EMP_NAME VARCHAR2(30) 
JOB_ID VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT 'SA_REP' 
SAL NUMBER 
COMM_PCT NUMBER 
MGR_ID NUMBER 
DEPARTMENT_ID NUMBER 

You need to update the records of employees 103 and 115. The UPDATE statement you 
specify should update the rows with the values specified below: 

JOB_ID: 
Default value specified for this column definition. 

SAL: 
Maximum salary earned for the job ID SA_REP. 

COMM_PCT: 
Default value specified for this commission percentage column, if any. 
If no default value is specified for the column, the value should be 
NULL. 

DEPARTMENT_ID: Supplied by the user during run time through substitution variable. 

Which UPDATE statement meets the requirements? 

A. UPDATE employees SET job_id = DEFAULT AND Sal = (SELECT MAX(sal) FROM employees WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP') AND comm_pct = DEFAULT AND department_id = &did WHERE employee_id IN (103,115); 
B. UPDATE employees SET job_id = DEFAULT AND Sal = MAX(sal) AND comm_pct = DEFAULT OR NULL AND department_id = &did WHERE employee_id IN (103,115) AND job_id = 'SA_REP'; 
C. UPDATE employees SET job_id = DEFAULT, Sal = (SELECT MAX(sal) FROM employees WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP'), comm_pct = DEFAULT, department_id = &did WHERE employee_id IN (103,115); 
D. UPDATE employees SET job_id = DEFAULT, Sal = MAX(sal), comm_pct = DEFAULT, department_id = &did WHERE employee_id IN (103,115) AND job_id = 'SA_REP'; 
E. UPDATE employees SET job_id = DEFAULT, Sal = (SELECT MAX(sal) FROM employees WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP') comm_pct = DEFAULT OR NULL, department_id = &did WHERE employee_id IN (103,115); 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 

This UPDATE statement is correct to receive desired results. Correct syntax is UPDATE 
table_name SET column_name1 = value, column_name2 = value2. You can also use the 
DEFAULT keyword to set a column value to its specified default value in update statements 
as well. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
You cannot use syntax like UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = value AND 
column_name2 = value2. Correct syntax is UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = 
value, column_name2 = value2. 
B: 
You cannot use syntax like UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = value AND 
column_name2 = value2. Correct syntax is UPDATE table_name SET column_name1 = 
value, column_name2 = value2. 
D: 
Group function is not allowed to use in the SET clause of the UPDATE command. 
E: 
You cannot set column to value DEFAULT OR NULL: this is wrong syntax to use.

Which two statements about sequences are true? (Choose two) 

A. You use a NEXTVAL pseudo column to look at the next possible value that would be generated from a sequence, without actually retrieving the value. 
B. You use a CURRVAL pseudo column to look at the current value just generated from a sequence, without affecting the further values to be generated from the sequence. 
C. You use a NEXTVAL pseudo column to obtain the next possible value from a sequence by actually retrieving the value from the sequence. 
D. You use a CURRVAL pseudo column to generate a value from a sequence that would be used for a specified database column. 
E. If a sequence starting from a value 100 and incremented by 1 is used by more then one application, then all of these applications could have a value of 105 assigned to their column whose value is being generated by the sequence. 
F. You use REUSE clause when creating a sequence to restart the sequence once it generates the maximum value defined for the sequence. 
Answer: B, C 
Explanation: 

You use a CURRVAL pseudo column to look at the current value just generated from a 
sequence, without affecting the further values to be generated from the sequence. You use a 
NEXTVAL pseudo column to obtain the next possible value from a sequence by actually 
retrieving the value from the sequence. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
You use a NEXTVAL pseudo column to obtain the next possible value from a sequence 
by actually retrieving the value from the sequence. 
D: You use a CURRVAL pseudo column to look at the current value just generated from a 
sequence, without affecting the further values to be generated from the sequence. 
E: 
This statement is not correct. There is no limitation like that in Oracle. 
F: 
You use CYCLE clause, not REUSE, when creating a sequence to restart the sequence 
once it generates the maximum value defined for the sequence.

Which operator can be used with a multiple-row subquery? 


A. = 
B. LIKE 
C. BETWEEN 
D. NOT IN 
E. IS 
F. <> 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 

Only NOT IN operator can be used with a multi-row sub-query. All others may be used with 
single-row sub-query only. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
When sub-queries are linked to the parent by equality comparisons, the parent query 
expects only one row of data from the sub-query, so “=” operator cannot be used with a 
multiple-row sub-query. 
B: 
Operator LIKE will work only with single-row sub-queries. 
C: 
Operator BETWEEN will not work with a multi-row sub-queries. 
E: 
Operator LIKE is used only for single-row sub-queries. 
F: 
When sub-queries are linked to the parent by equality comparisons, the parent query 
expects only one row of data from the sub-query, so “<>” operator cannot be used with a 
multiple-row sub-query.

A. UNIQUE 
B. NOT NULL 
C. CHECK 
D. PRIMARY KEY 
E. FOREIGN KEY 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 

The NOT NULL constraint can be defined only at the column level. It enforces that a value 
must be defined for this column such that the column may not be NULL for any row. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
The UNIQUE constraint enforces uniqueness on values in the constrained column. It can 
be defined not only at the column level. 
C: 
The CHECK constraint enforces that values added to the constrained column must be 
present in a static list of values permitted for the column. 
D: 
The PRIMARY KEY constraint stipulates that values in the constrained column(s) must 
be unique and not NULL. If the primary key applies to multiple columns, then the 
combination of values in the columns must be unique and not NULL. 
E: 
The FOREIGN KEY constraint enforces that only values in the primary key of a parent

Which two statements complete a transaction? (Choose two) 

A. DELETE employees; 
B. DESCRIBE employees; 
C. ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT C; 
D. GRANT SELECT ON employees TO SCOTT; 
E. ALTER TABLE employees SET UNUSED COLUMN sal; 
F. Select MAX(sal) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 20; 
Answer: C, E 
Explanation: 
It is important to understand that an implicit COMMIT occurs on the database when a user 
exits SQL*Plus or issues a data-definition language (DDL) command such as a CREATE 
TABLE statement, used to create a database object, or an ALTER TABLE statement, used to 
alter a database object. Also after the ROLLBACK command is issued, a new transaction is 
started implicitly by the database session. 

Incorrect Answers 

A: 
The DELETE command is data-manipulation language (DML) command and it does not 
complete a transaction. 
B: 
The DESCRIBE command is internal SQL*Plus command and it has nothing to do with 
completion a transaction. 
D: 
The GRANT command is data-control language (DCL) command to control user access to 
data. It will not complete a transaction. 
F: 
SELECT command is used to retrieve data. It does not complete a transaction.

Evaluate the SQL statement 

DROP TABLE DEPT: 


Which four statements are true of the SQL statement? (Choose four) 

A. You cannot roll back this statement. 
B. All pending transactions are committed. 
C. All views based on the DEPT table are deleted. 
D. All indexes based on the DEPT table are dropped. 
E. All data in the table is deleted, and the table structure is also deleted. 
F. All data in the table is deleted, but the structure of the table is retained. 
G. All synonyms based on the DEPT table are deleted. 
Answer: A, B, D, E 
Explanation: 

You cannot roll back DROP TABLE statement. All pending transactions related on this table 
are committed. If the table is dropped, Oracle automatically drops any index, trigger and 
constraint associated with the table as well. All data in the table is deleted, and the table 
structure is also deleted. 

Incorrect Answers 

C: 
All views based on the DEPT table become invalid, but they are not deleted. 
F: 
All data in the table is deleted, and the table structure is also deleted. Command 
TRUNCATE deletes all data in the table, but does not delete the structure of the table.
